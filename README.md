# Vex Over Under VRC 9204A Code

## Changelog and notes
* Made separate programs for Arcade and Tank drive
* Set drivetrain stopping to brake

Avoid driving reverse because the robot can be unstable and lift possibly could affect Auton

### 11/2
* Added button selector to cycle through Auton
* Intake automatically stops after releasing Triball

### 11/3
* Added Auton: Near side with hanging pole touch

Auton is consistent in scoring Preloads. Needs more testing on descoring matchload - try testing more specific placement and rotation of matchload

### 11/6
* Renamed R2_pressed() to acorn_release()
* Renamed L1_pressed() to catapult_launch()
* Renamed R1_pressed() to acorn_grab()
* Renamed X_pressed() to push()
* Renamed A_pressed() to arm_drop()

### 11/7
* Added automatic and manual controls for catapult launching
* Added Auton: Far side with hanging pole touch
Far side Auton still needs testing
