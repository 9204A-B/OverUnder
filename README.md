# Changelog and notes
## 11/1
* Made separate programs for Arcade and Tank drive
* Set drivetrain stopping to brake

Avoid driving reverse because the robot can be unstable and lift possibly could affect Auton

## 11/2
* Added button selector to cycle through Auton
* Intake automatically stops after releasing triball

## 11/3
* Added Auton: Near side with hanging pole touch

Auton is consistent in scoring preload. Needs more testing on descoring matchload - try testing more specific placement and rotation of matchload
